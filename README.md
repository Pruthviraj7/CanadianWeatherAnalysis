# Canadian Weather Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of historical temperature data across Canadian provinces from 1973 to 2023. Using Power BI, I have created a comprehensive dashboard to visualize and understand temperature trends, seasonal changes, and provincial differences.

## Dashboard Features

### Page 1: Province-Level Analysis
- **Cards**: Displaying key metrics such as percentage of missing data, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and average temperature.
- **Map Visualization**: Showing the average temperature and record counts of each province.
- **Clustered Bar Chart**: Comparing average minimum and maximum temperatures across provinces.
- **Table**: Detailed information on station, latitude, longitude, and elevation for each province.
- **Slicers**: Enabling dynamic filtering by province and year.

### Page 2: Decade and Seasonal Analysis
- **Clustered Column Chart**: Showing average temperatures by decade and season.
- **Pie Charts**: Displaying maximum and minimum temperatures by decade and their percentages.
- **Slicers**: Allowing selection of season, year, and decade for detailed analysis.

## Key Insights

### Seasonal and Decade Insights
- **Fall** 🍁:
  - 1970s: Avg Max Temp: 0.3°C, Avg Min Temp: -0.3°C
  - 2020s: Avg Max Temp: 10.3°C, Avg Min Temp: 0.8°C
- **Spring** 🌸:
  - 1970s: Avg Max Temp: -3.1°C, Avg Min Temp: -14.1°C
  - 2020s: Avg Max Temp: 7.5°C, Avg Min Temp: -3.8°C
- **Winter** ❄️:
  - 1970s: Avg Max Temp: -15.9°C, Avg Min Temp: -16.6°C
  - 2020s: Avg Max Temp: -5.3°C, Avg Min Temp: -14.0°C
- **Summer** ☀️:
  - 1970s: Avg Max Temp: 12.0°C, Avg Min Temp: 9.9°C
  - 2020s: Avg Max Temp: 22.6°C, Avg Min Temp: 10.8°C

### Overall Temperature Trends
- **1970s**: Avg Max Temp: 8.2°C, Avg Min Temp: -2.3°C
- **2020s**: Avg Max Temp: 8.8°C, Avg Min Temp: -1.6°C

### Province Highlights
- **Nunavut**: Coldest province with a recorded minimum temperature of around -59.0°C and an average of -19.8°C.
- **British Columbia**: Warmest province with a recorded maximum temperature of 49.6°C and an average of 7.0°C.

## Recommendations
- **Focus on Fall Warming**: The significant increase in fall temperatures from the 1970s to the 2020s suggests a trend towards milder fall seasons. This could affect agricultural planning, requiring adjustments in crop selection and harvesting schedules to optimize yield.
- **Monitor Winter Extremes**: Despite a general warming trend, winter temperatures still show significant variability. Ensuring robust infrastructure and emergency preparedness can help mitigate the impact of severe cold spells, particularly in provinces like Nunavut, where extreme cold is most prevalent.
- **Adaptation in British Columbia**: With British Columbia experiencing the highest recorded temperatures, efforts to combat heat waves and related health risks should be prioritized. This includes public health campaigns and improving cooling infrastructure.

## Data Source
